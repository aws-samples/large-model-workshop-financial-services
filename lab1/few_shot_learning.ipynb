For example, the [TensorFlow](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/tensorflow/using_tf.html) estimator can be used to launch a training job using TensorFlow. In this example, we use the [HuggingFace](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/huggingface/index.html) estimator to launch a training job. \n",

Similar to the Estimator SDK used to create the Training job, we can use the [HuggingFaceModel](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/huggingface/index.html) object to deploy the model to an endpoint. Instead of a training script, we provide an inference script [inference.py](src/inference.py) which will be used to load the model and perform inference. Our inference.py script needs to implement two functions: `model_fn` and `transform_fn`. The `model_fn` function is used to load the model and the `transform_fn` function is used to perform inference for each request. \n",

You simply need to write code to take the contents of `model_dir` and return the model object. \n",
